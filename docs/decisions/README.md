# Architecture Decision Records

ADRs preserve durable implementation decisions and their consequences. Plans may reference proposed ADRs, but public contracts must not rely on them until their status is Accepted.

## Status values

- `Proposed`: under discussion and not authoritative;
- `Accepted`: current architecture rule;
- `Superseded`: replaced by a newer ADR;
- `Rejected`: considered but not selected.

## Naming

Use `NNNN-short-title.md`. Never rewrite the reasoning of an accepted ADR to make history look cleaner; supersede it with a new ADR.
